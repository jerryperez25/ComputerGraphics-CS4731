CS 4731 Project 2

Inside of this zip file, you will find 4 files and 2 folders:

- Pjt2.js - holds all of the javascript work
- Pjt2 HTML.html - holds all of the graphical interface work
- Style.css - holds all of the styling for the html 
- README.txt - describes project
- Ply files - contains all ply files for this assignment
- lib - contains given libraries

Walkthrough of the JavaScript:

When thinking about the code, it seemed more logical to split it into 2 separate main portions of code. The first of which are the key presses that control the translations, rotation, and pulsing. The second portion of code handles the file manipulations which consists of intaking, cleaning, and handling the data. The javascript also has many functions that reduce redundancy in the code. The best piece of constructive criticism that I was given for project 1 was for keeping majority of my code in main. This time I have made functions for all repetitive and fairly large chunks of code. You will see functions that range from buffer work, to the newell method, to rendering/drawing capabilities, and so on. 

Walkthrough of the HTML:

The HTMl contains brief instructions at the users possession to appropriately navigate through the program. It also highlights the canvas in black to demonstrate the working space. The description on the side is there as a visual aid in case the button presses are not explicitly given to them.
